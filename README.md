Description: This program gives you the option to either create an arraylist of random integers or manually enter them. 
It then sorts the arraylist using 2 methods, Bubble sort and Selection sort. It then prints the sorted arraylist with the orginal arraylist created.
It also prints the amount of time it took the computer to process each sort. 
You are allowed to enter as many integers as you want to be sorted and the program will accommodate for that. 
My partners for this project were Ben and Kennedi.
